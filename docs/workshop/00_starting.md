## Connecting to teaching0

Open a terminal and type:

`ssh -X teaching0`

This should present you with a prompt:

`<username>@teaching0:~$`

### Loading CASTEP
The command

`module load phys/CASTEP`

should load castep into the environment as `castep.mpi`. You can test this with

`castep.mpi -v`


### Loading Vesta
There is an incompatability with the VESTA and CASTEP modules on teaching0.

Instead, open a new terminal and connect again to teaching0 (`ssh -X teaching0`). You can then load the VESTA module with:

`module load vis/VESTA`

and run it:

`VESTA`


## Connecting to young
Open a terminal and type

`ssh -X mmmXXXX@young.rc.ucl.ac.uk`

replacing mmmXXXX with your young account. This should present you with a shell on young:

`[mmm0389@login01 ~]$`

If you want to use the castep tools, (c2x, orbitals2bands, etc), you should add these to your path:

`export PATH=$PATH:/home/mmm0389/castep-24`

This will give you access to castep.mpi as well as the full suite of tools that come with castep.

### Copy the submission script

To actually run castep on this machine, you need to use a submission script. This is similar to how most HPC systems work, and is useful if you intend to learn how to run castep on your own cluster.

`cp ~mmm0389/run_castep24.sh ~/`

This will give you a file called run_castep24.sh in your home folder. You *must* edit this file and change the line UKCP_YORK_P to be your relevant group on young (probably UKCP_EXT).. Please ask if you are not sure, as this will give errors later on. 

### Scratch

All calculations must be performed in the Scratch folder. This is a high speed filesystem for use in HPC environments. The folder is ~/Scratch 

### Running a castep calculation

Create the cell and param files as normal. Copy the script into the folder and edit the final line which contains "Si2". Change this to be the <name> part of your castep calculation.

eg. If your files are Al.cell and Al.param, change the last line to read

`gerun castep.mpi Al`

The number of cores are controlled by the line

`#$ -pe mpi 16`

and the job time limit by

`#$ -l h_rt=0:20:0`

requests a 20 minute (max) run.

Once this file has been edited, submit it to the queue with

`qsub run_castep24.sh`

You can see the status of the job by typing

`qstat`

which will show your active jobs, eg.

```
[mmm0389@login01 ~]$ qstat
job-ID  prior   name       user         state submit/start at     queue                          slots ja-task-ID
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1141619 2.51381 Castep-exa mmm0389      qw    09/19/2023 12:04:38                                   16
```


It should change from "qw" (queued and waiting) to "r" (running) and then once the calculation is complete, it should disappear.

To cancel a job, use the job-id from qstat and type

`qdel <job number>`



## Editing a file
Edit the diamond.param file (increase the cutoff energy to 400 eV). To do this you will need to use an editor. (for experts `vi` and `emacs` are available). Otherwise I suggest using an editor called `nano`. This has helpful list of instructions are the bottom of the screen (but ask if you are confused!)

`[teaching01@arc-login01 ~]$ nano diamond.param`

Now submit the job again.

Compare the runs at 200 and 400eV. Which took longer? Has the total energy gone up or down. Look at the Atomic Populations section - is it what you expect?

## Summary of useful commands
* `mv`   - rename (or move) a file eg. `mv oldfile newfile`
* `cp`   - copy a file eg. `cp original copy`
* `pwd`   - print current (working) directory
* `mkdir`  - make a new directory (aka folder)
* `nano`   - a file editor eg. `nano filename`. Note you can use this to edit an existing file, or to create a new file. eg `nano mynewfile` will create a new file called `mynewfile`
* `ls`  - list files in the current directory
* `ls -l`  - list files - but give more details than plain `ls`
* `exit`  - to close the terminal when you are finished
* `cp fred/* jim/`  - copy all the files in the folder `fred` into the folder `jim`
* `cp ../myfile ./`  - copy the file `myfile` in the folder below to the current folder
* `cp ~/myfile ./`   - copy the file `myfile` in your home folder to the current folder
* `qstat`  - look at the list of jobs running and queued on the cluster
* `mpirun -np 8 castep.mpi diamond`  - submits a castep job with `diamond.cell` and `diamond.param` as inputs onto 8 cores with a time limit of 1 hour

### c2x
This is a handy free program written by Michael Rutter (TCM group Cambridge). It can convert
`castep.cell` and `castep.check` files into various formats eg `.cell`, `.pdb`. (and many other things!)

* `c2x -h`  - list all the options
* `c2x --pdbn castep.cell castep.pdb`
* `c2x --pdbn castep.check castep.pdb`
* `c2x --cell castep.check new.cell`
 (useful at the end of geometry optimisation)
