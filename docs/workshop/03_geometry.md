# Geometry Optimisation


## Exercise 1 - Dihydrogen dimer

In this tutorial we will model the bond length of a H2 molecule. This will give you the opportunity to get used to 
geometry optimisations and gain familiarity 

Remember you can use `castep --help` to assist you with finding the appropriate input parameters.

0. Create a new file, `H2.cell` using your favourite text editor, e.g.

	```
	nano H2.cell
	```
	
1. Start by creating a lattice block in your cell file.

	```
	%block lattice_abc
	5 5 5 
	90 90 90
	%endblock lattice_abc
	```

	or
	
	```
	%block lattice_cart
	5 0 0
	0 5 0
	0 0 5
	%endblock lattice_cart
	```
  
	Will produce a cube 5 Angstroms long on each side.

	**NOTE: ONLY USE ONE OF THESE TWO FORMATS**
	
	Q: Is this a big enough box to represent a molecule? (Recall Periodic Boundary Conditions)
	
	A: You may wish to test this by changing the size of the box.
	
2. Add atoms into our cell. This can be done either relative to the lattice vectors using

	```
	%block positions_frac
	H 0.5 0.5 0.5
	H 0.5 0.5 0.2
	%endblock positions_frac
	``` 
   or relative to the origin of the cell file
   
	```
	%block positions_abs
	H 3 3 3 
	H 3 3 4
	%endblock positions_abs
	```
	
	Q: If you are varying the size of your unit cell for tests, which one will be more convenient?

3. Add final components to unit cell
 
	```
	fix_all_cell: true
	kpoint_mp_grid: 1 1 1
	```
	Q: Why do we only want to use a single k-point?
	
	Q: Why do we want to fix the lattice parameters rather than letting them relax?

4. Now close `H2.cell` and create a `H2.param` file.

	In `H2.param` add
	
	```
	Task: GeometryOptimisation
	XC_Functional: LDA
	Cut_Off_Energy: 300
	```
	
	If you want to get Castep to automatically print out the final structure, you can also add
		
	```
	write_cell_structure: true
	```

	You can now use `mpirun` (or your submission script!) to submit your geometry optimisation!

5. Results Analysis

	* Scroll down through the file. Check to see how the forces and bond-length varies over iterations.
	* For advanced bash users, try `grep "F|max" H2.castep` to extract this from the file.
	* You may also want to visualise the `H2.cell` and (if you told castep to print it) the `H2-out.cell` files as in previous tutorials
	* Finally, consider watching the optimisation by drag-and-dropping the `H2.geom` file into `Jmol` (VESTA will not animate it)
	* The experimental H2 bond length is about 0.74 Angstroms. How does your result compare? Extension A may give some insight into this! 

### Extensions

You may wish to split these between groups and discuss the results

#### A. Functional Choice

So far you've used the local density approximation (LDA) for the exchange-correlation functional in this exercise. Repeat your calculation with the `PBE` exchange-correlation functional (a popular GGA):

* ``xc_functional : PBE``
* You may also want to consider a hybrid functional such as `HSE06` or the meta-GGA `RSCAN`

#### B. More Precise Structural Optimisations

You may wish to have more precise structure for certain  calculations such as `NMR` or `Phonons`. These may be controlled in the `.param` file with
  
```
geom_force_tol: 0.05 eV/ang
geom_energy_tol: 2e-5 eV
geom_stress_tol: 0.1 GPa 
geom_disp_tol: 0.001 ang
```
  
These are the default values; what happens to your final values when you alter them?
  
**Hint:** You have fixed the lattice - what will stress do?

#### C. Wavefunction Convergence

If you have a bad wavefunction you will get bad forces. To demonstrate this try adding
  
```
elec_energy_tol: 0.1
```
  
This overwrites the default of `0.00001 ev` and will make the SCF convergence very fast. What does this do to the geometry optimisation?
  
**NOTE:** This is not something you want to do in practice! Hopefully working through this example will demonstrate why.


## Exercise 2

  Run a geometry optimisation on silicon.

  You can use a silicon input file from one of the previous tutorials as a starting point for your input files.

  Set CASTEP's parameters to perform a geometry optimisation using a 160 eV plane-wave cut-off energy and an 8x8x8 Monkhorst-Pack k-point grid:
  
  In `Si2.param`:
  
  ```
  task : geometry optimisation
  cut_off_energy : 160 eV 
  ```
    
  In `Si2.cell`:
  
  ```
  kpoints_MP_grid 8 8 8
  ```

  Because you're going to change the lattice vectors, CASTEP will do a finite basis-set correction (FBSC); this will calculate and print out dEtotal/dlog(Ecut) â€“         anything more than 0.1 eV/atom is big and a sign of incomplete convergence.


  Q: What is the final lattice parameter?


  Do convergence tests (cut_off_energy, kpoints etc). The experimental lattice constant is 3.84 Angstrom - how does your value compare?
  What is the difference in your results between calculations using an LDA and a PBE exchange-correlation functional?

## Exercise 3 - Graphene

It can be useful to know how to construct a monolayer material, such as graphene.
This requires the use of cell constraints so that we force a large distance between periodic images
(and we don't have the system collapse to form graphite!)
  
In your `.cell` file:
  
```
%block cell_constraints
1 1 0
3 4 5
%endblock cell_constraints
```
  
Will force the `a` and `b` lattice parameters to be the same (though free to vary jointly), fix the `c` lattice vector,
and let all angles relax independently. This is similar to the `%block lattice_abc` structure you saw earlier.
  
For the mathematically minded, this is taking the limit that the interlayer spacing, controlled by the out-of-plane lattice vector, goes to infinity!
  
Practically, we cannot actually set the lattice parameter to infinity - try varying it and seeing how it converges with distance.
